Welcome to Naas's Content Creation Engine! A powerful data product that enables you to track your content performance across platforms, leverage AI for optimized strategies and assistance in writing impactful new content that will increase reach & boost engagement.

## **How Does It Work?**

This repository is structured as follows:

- The **`/assets`** folder stores any PNG, JPG, GIF, CSV, diagrams, or slides related to the documentation of the product.
- The **`/inputs`** folder stores the parameters and any other files needed (data, referential) to run the models files.
- The **`/models`** folder stores any files that transform inputs into outputs.
- The **`/outputs`** folder stores all the files that would be exposed outside of the Naas server.
- The **`/tests`** folder stores all tests to be performed before production.
- The **`/utils`** folder stores all common functions used across files.
- The **`requirements.txt`** file lists all the packages and dependencies.
- The **`setup.ipynb`** file runs the product on a Naas server.
- The **`update.ipynb`** file pulls this repository again.
